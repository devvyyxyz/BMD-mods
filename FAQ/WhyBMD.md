# Why Choose Bot Maker for Discord

!!!Primary Note
I have tried to be as unbiased as possible. The following statements are purely factual and not personal opinions.
!!!

## Comparison with Other Bot Makers
The bot makers I will be comparing this app with are:
- **Discord Bot Maker (DBM)**
- **Discord Bot Builder (DBB)**
- **Bot Studio for Discord (BS(f)D)**

## Generalized User Types
- **I want the latest Discord API features without having the app:**  
  **Bot Maker for Discord (BMD)**

- **I’m fine with modding the app for extra features:**  
  **DBB, BMD\*, DBM\***  
  - Note: DBM-Mods doesn’t include the latest Discord API v10 features.  
  - BMD has a wide range of mods, but the app's base includes plenty of features, reducing the need for them.

- **I want stability and wouldn’t mind having an outdated feature set:**  
  **DBM, BS(f)D\***  
  - BS(f)D has a mediocre base, and mods cannot be used within events, which are essential for command functionality. Its integration of slash commands, buttons, and select menus is lacking.

- **I want a bot maker with lots of video tutorials:**  
  **DBM, BS(f)D\***  
  - Many BS(f)D tutorials are under the name "Discord Bot Studio" due to a name change.

- **I want an app that's in active development:**  
  **BMD\*, DBB\***  
  - Rat is a human and cannot incorporate all suggestions in each update, so BMD may not always have the features you suggest.  
  - DBB has shown limited update activity recently; the developer went on a lengthy break before releasing an update.

- **I want something that I can speedrun:**  
  **BMD, DBM**

- **I want something that's easily readable (allowing me to pick up where I left off the next day):**  
  **BMD, DBM**  
  - Due to extreme similarities between DBM and BMD, they are practically identical in this regard.  
  - Discord Bot Builder would be included, but workspaces can get cluttered easily.

- **I’m an organization freak:**  
  **BMD, DBM**

- **I want customization:**  
  **BMD**

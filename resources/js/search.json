It's integration of slash commands, buttons and select menus is an afterthought and is not enjoyable for day-to-day usage.","DBB has shown little update activity recently. The app's developer went on a lengthy break before releasing an update. Developer claims they didn't take a break off and just fully rewrote the app.","DBM-Mods doesn't include the latest Discord API v10 features.","Discord Bot Builder would've been included, but workspaces can get cluttered easily.","Due to extreme similarities inbetween DBM and BMD, they are basically identical in this chapter.","I want a bot maker with lots of video tutorials -> DBM, BS(f)D*","I want an app that's in active development -> BMD*, DBB*","I want customization -> BMD","I want something that I can speedrun -> BMD, DBM","I want something that's easily readable (allowing me pick up where I left off the next day after doing progress on command) -> BMD, DBM","I want stability & wouldn't mind having an outdated featureset -> DBM, BS(f)D*","I want the latest Discord API features without having the app -> BMD","I'm an organization freak -> BMD, DBM","I'm fine with modding the app for extra features -> DBB, BMD*, DBM*","Rat is a human and cannot include more than a few suggestions in each update, therefore BMD may not always have the features you suggest."]},{"l":"Pros-and-cons","p":["[CON] Gets messy really fast","[CON] Heavily relies on the modding community for most features","[CON] new features may be unstable","[CON] No longer maintained","[CON] not that accessible","[CON] Outdated (Discord API v9)","[PRO] constantly improving","[PRO] convenience & convenient features (command aliases, cooldowns, mods are not essential","[PRO] Easier to pick up","[PRO] heavily focuses on speed of navigation / making repetitive tasks less tedious","[PRO] Huge community","[PRO] humane design","[PRO] In somewhat active development","[PRO] no DRM & no license/copyright applied to your project (except the node modules').","[PRO] Plenty of mods","[PRO] project manager (manage multiple projects at a time)","[PRO] Stable","[PRO] themable","[PRO] up-to-date","[PRO] uses oceanic.js instead of discord.js, providing less ram usage","Bot Maker for Discord","Discord Bot Builder","Discord Bot Maker"]}],[{"l":"AreProjectsCopyrighted","p":["Aside from the third-party node modules they use, no, projects are not licensed nor copyrighted.

Something like a free host simply doesn't exist. Sure, it may be free as in no payment required, but in this world, how can something be free, especially a piece of hardware? It's simple: you're paying with your data and probably your time, or the host will fall apart in less than a year.","So should you use a free host? In my opinion (and probably some others here): nope. Just don't do it. Pay for a small VPS from a good provider and you will have something with stability and assurance that your bot will stay online (as long as you pay). Also, when buying a VPS, you can run other things besides the Discord bot (because your bot probably doesn't have a high usage count if you're asking for a free host), like other Discord bots, Pi-hole, or a lightweight VPN etc.","Some personal recommendations for hosts:","Hetzner Cloud: https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/","Contabo: https://contabo.com/en/vps/","Linode: https://www.linode.com/","P.S.: Please secure your server properly.
